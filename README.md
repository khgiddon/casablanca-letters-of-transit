# casablanca-letters-of-transit

This repo contains the Jupyter notebook for my blog post ["Who signed the letters of transit in *Casablanca*? A Bayesian approach"](https://www.kylegiddon.com/casablanca-letters-of-transit/). 

The main file is `casablanca.ipynb`.

Some images in the final graph are overlaid separately in an image editor, because trying to align images using matplotlib is a pain. The final graph is in the `output` folder.
